# NuGrid 8

## Tuesday morning

* git tutorial

### Not yet done
* regression test suite, Travis CI
* VM Nubuntu 16
* examples, example notebook, OZoNE

## Tuesday afternoon
* Jaqueline has issue with resolution, one big C-DUP in the middle  - what is going on there. Not every )sub-grid model_ must be convergable. :: Need to look at that in more detail
* CF explains his SN parameterizations for CCSN for explosion, are these parameters that could be modeled with hydro simulations? e.g. the convective transport

* Oleg:
	- difference between macronova and kilonova
	- decay network _directed acyclic graph_ for solving for the final decay, which is not time dependent, Oleg wants  to add this as a NuGrid tool
	- fission rates very uncertain and effect Eu, but not for 150<A<180 
	- CF: NS rates are wrong, paper with Surmann
	- @oleg/marcop: tell us what r-process yields are good, CF says: read the papers!!
	- NS retention in galaxies: 
	   * Fryer, C. L., Woosley, S. E., & Hartmann, D. H. 1999, ApJ, 526, 152
		* Bloom, J. S., Sigurdsson, S., & Pols, O. R. 1999, MNRAS, 305, 763 
		* Belczynski, K., Perna, R., Bulik, T., et al. 2006, ApJ, 648, 1110


	
* massiv stars:
	- CBM and Ilka bear on code comparison paper II (:: how?)
	- EC-SN yields missing, no evidence they exist, yet we may from Sam's work extract trajectories and post-processes them, to add them 
	- Austin
		* CF suggests we look at this models in more detail
		* MP suggests to add simple explosion and abundance analysis
	- Ilka
		* magnetic supression of convection in the outer main-sequence which could be responsible for creating blue super giants
		* resolution in time and mass grid - what is needed for _converged_ models?

* AGB stars (MP)
	- new C13 pocket based on internal gravity waves reproduces, e.g. [Rb/Fe] vs. [s/Fe], but [hs/ls] is too large because of missing rotation or poisoning?
	- new projects:
		* PN
		* presolar grains, Si MACS
	- FH: can we use parameterized cases for rotation induced mixing that provide 2 additional cases representing rotation-induced mixing 
* massive star H-ingestion and signature in pre-solar grains (MP)
